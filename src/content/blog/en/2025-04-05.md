## Introduction
Hi, I'm Mizuame, also an Unreal Engine engineer at [Santa Sunrise Inc.](https://www.wantedly.com/companies/company_7620771). (This article is Powered By Santa Sunrise Inc.)
Today we'll move characters not with Blueprints or C++, but with TypeScript.

LLMs are advancing, and Unity C# gets heavy AI assistance.
But UE's Blueprints are GUI-based, making it unreasonable to code with even multimodal LLMs.
However, my experience having LLMs write low-level languages like Rust and C++ is still rough.

So, a scripting language that's code-based is needed for UE (right?)

That's where TypeScript comes in.

## Using PureTS

https://github.com/Tencent/puerts

A plugin by Tencent that lets you write Unity/Unreal in TypeScript.

Frequently updated, supporting UE4.22 through latest 5.5.

## What's Happening?

Some of this I don't fully understand. Sorry if wrong.

C++ doesn't have reflection, but Unreal Engine uses:
```cpp
UCLASS() USTRUCT() UENUM()
```
meta info to generate reflection.

```cpp
UObject::ProcessEvent
```
And call arbitrary functions.

Reference:
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/CoreUObject/UObject/UObject/ProcessEvent

https://qiita.com/unknown_ds/items/30ea13c9d50f2c2de6ff

PureTS generates TypeScript type definitions and provides binding layer with V8/QuickJS/Node.js.

Performance concerns for reflection-based binding, but:

https://github.com/Tencent/puerts/tree/master/unreal

It's sufficiently practical according to their benchmarks.


## Using It

Get the appropriate version from [releases](https://github.com/Tencent/puerts/releases).

For UE5.2, Unreal_v1.0.5 worked.
https://github.com/Tencent/puerts/releases/tag/Unreal_v1.0.5

Place like normal Plugin.
C++ project conversion required.

### Create Type Definition Files

```text
Puerts.Gen
```

Run the command or:

![](/blog-content-img/2025-04-05/image-1-4e6d0e7873c3.png)

Press the editor button,

```text
Plugins\Puerts\Typing\ue
```
and
```text
"ue.d.ts"
```
```text
"puerts.d.ts"
```

These two type definition files should be exported.

### File Placement

```text
MyProject/
├── Config/
├── Content/
├── Source/
├── TypeScript/
└── MyProject.uproject
```

Create TypeScript folder at project root, place the two files.
Verify types are recognized in your code editor.

### Mode Change
In
```text
Plugins\Puerts
```
run:
```bash
node enable_puerts_module.js
```

Verify
```text
tsconfig.json
```
was generated at root.

### Configuration Change
Add to tsconfig.json:
```json
"skipLibCheck": true,
```

### Write Code
Write in the Typing folder.
Transpile with tsc; js goes to
```text
Content\JavaScript
```
with the same name.
At this point:

1. Starts with `import * as UE from 'ue';`
2. File name matches class name
3. Ends with `export default ClassName;`

Without these three, it won't be recognized in the editor.

```typescript
import * as UE from 'ue';
class TS_Character extends UE.Character {
    SpringArm: UE.SpringArmComponent;
    Camera: UE.CameraComponent;

    WalkSpeed: number = 600.0;
    MouseSensitivity: number = 1.0;

    Constructor() {
        // Character movement settings
        this.bUseControllerRotationPitch = false;
        this.bUseControllerRotationYaw = false;
        this.bUseControllerRotationRoll = false;

        this.CharacterMovement.bOrientRotationToMovement = true;
        this.CharacterMovement.RotationRate = new UE.Rotator(0.0, 540.0, 0.0);
        this.CharacterMovement.MaxWalkSpeed = this.WalkSpeed;

        this.SpringArm = this.CreateDefaultSubobject(
            "SpringArm",
            UE.SpringArmComponent.StaticClass(),
            UE.SpringArmComponent.StaticClass(),
            true,
            false
        ) as UE.SpringArmComponent;
        this.SpringArm.SetupAttachment(this.RootComponent, "");
        this.SpringArm.TargetArmLength = 300.0;
        this.SpringArm.bUsePawnControlRotation = true;

        // Camera setup
        this.Camera = this.CreateDefaultSubobject(
            "Camera",
            UE.CameraComponent.StaticClass(),
            UE.CameraComponent.StaticClass(),
            true,
            false
        ) as UE.CameraComponent;
        this.Camera.SetupAttachment(this.SpringArm, "");
        this.Camera.bUsePawnControlRotation = false;
    }


    // Called when game starts
    ReceiveBeginPlay(): void {
        super.ReceiveBeginPlay();

    }

    MoveForward(Value: number): void {
        if (Value != 0.0 && this.Controller) {
            const Rotation = this.Controller.GetControlRotation();
            const YawRotation = new UE.Rotator(0, Rotation.Yaw, 0);

            const Direction = UE.KismetMathLibrary.GetForwardVector(YawRotation);

            this.AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
        }
    }

    MoveRight(Value: number): void {
        if (Value != 0.0 && this.Controller) {
            const Rotation = this.Controller.GetControlRotation();
            const YawRotation = new UE.Rotator(0, Rotation.Yaw, 0);

            const Direction = UE.KismetMathLibrary.GetRightVector(YawRotation);

            this.AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
        }
    }


}

export default TS_Character;
```

Write using syntax highlighting and LSP.

LLMs help somewhat but often lie, so fixes are needed.

### Execution

After tsc transpile, check if recognized in editor.

![](/blog-content-img/2025-04-05/image-2-77f8ada676d4.png)

If successful, it should be recognized.

## Summary
How was it?

While writing Unreal C++ with LLMs is tough, TypeScript works reasonably well, so feeding in domain knowledge (context window, fine-tuning) could be practical.

But currently, users still need TypeScript, Unreal, and some C++ knowledge.

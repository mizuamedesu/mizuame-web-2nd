This article is Day 7 of [coins Advent Calendar 2024](https://adventar.org/calendars/10367).

## What is Buy Me a Coffee?

[Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/)

It's a donation platform, like super chats.
Payments go through Stripe, and you register your bank account with Stripe.
The fee is 5%.

## Setup

When creating an account, you'll register a bank account via Stripe.
Takes about 5 minutes.

Then you configure your page.
You can set arbitrary prices (from $1), or set a price per Coffee (from $1) and let supporters buy multiple.

Memberships are also available.

There's also a Shop feature for selling Zoom call rights or digital data.

## Why I Added It

Because I want money.
But also, as I [wrote in another blog](https://sisou.mizuame.works/?id=006), I used to have ads but they barely generated revenue while significantly hurting the blog's visibility and usability, so I removed all ads.
Moving the blog and app storage entirely to Cloudflare means no costs for now, but there will definitely be costs later (mainly R2).
So I'm opening donations.

## Embedding the Code

You can generate embed code for buttons and widgets, just paste it.

```html
<script data-name="BMC-Widget" data-cfasync="false" src="https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js" data-id="mizuame" data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message="Please donate!" data-color="#5F7FFF" data-position="Right" data-x_margin="18" data-y_margin="18"></script>
```

Installed. A button appears in the bottom right, with an initial popup.

Clicking opens the purchase screen.

## Future Plans

I'm thinking of starting a membership and listing members' names at the bottom of the blog.
If anyone registers, I might write an Unreal Engine article once a month.

That's all.

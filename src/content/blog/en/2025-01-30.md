## Hitting the Maintenance Limit

Until now, I was committing the folly of writing raw HTML without any framework.

I created an [end-of-life converter](https://github.com/mizuamedesu/mbs_converter), generating blogs one by one, rewriting, generating sitemaps...
I hit my limit.
This was fine at first, but it's clearly reinventing the wheel and unsustainable.

## Switching
So I decided to switch to a modern framework.
First, I think Next.js is a fake framework, so that's out. Between Hugo and Astro, I chose Astro after using it to build a site for [HSCaT](https://hscat.org/), a university club, and being captivated by its rationality.

## Some Articles Destroyed...
I migrated articles I had painstakingly written in HedgeDoc, but blew up the others. Sorry...

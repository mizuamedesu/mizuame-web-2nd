This is a memo about passing the Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination at lightning speed as a high school student.
**This article was originally posted on Qiita.**

### More Precisely: 25h for Applied + 2h for Fundamental

Originally, I was taking the Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination, but **I completely underestimated it,** and my self-scored morning section was 55%, so I hurriedly switched to the Fundamental exam.
About 25 hours for Applied and 2 hours for Fundamental, totaling 27 hours.

### The Afternoon B Section is Manageable If You've Done Algorithms

I'm a high school senior, not a programmer, but I've been making games for about two years using Blueprints (a node-based version of C++) in Unreal Engine. So I had decent exposure to algorithms.
And I got cocky thinking **"I can do this without studying"**, but I barely managed with **635 points**.

### The Morning A Section Doesn't Overlap Much with Applied

This might have been coincidental, but there wasn't much overlap. The Applied exam had quite a few problems at the end that you could solve with just calculation and reasoning without specific knowledge, but the Fundamental exam felt more knowledge-heavy.
Conversely, if you study properly with enough time, you should pass normally. Also, Applied has more humanities-oriented content, while Fundamental is more IT-focused. Score: **605/1000 points** Phew, that was close!

### Study Method the Day Before

I only studied for the Fundamental exam the day before. I watched YouTube videos in a playlist at double speed while reading manga. This was enough for the A section.

### Conclusion: Study Well in Advance

I didn't know CBT shows your score immediately after finishing, and when I pressed the end button, my score suddenly appeared and my heart skipped a beat.
Study and prepare with plenty of time. By the way, you can normally skip the breaks.

## filebrowser is Easy to Use

Have you heard of filebrowser? NextCloud might be more famous for file servers.

[filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) is open source, and if you want to run it on Windows, just launching the exe completes all setup.

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filebrowser/get/master/get.ps1 | iex
filebrowser -r /path/to/your/files
```
Check the [official site](https://filebrowser.org/installation) for details, but just this launches a file server.

What's great about filebrowser is that files are directly stored under a single specified root folder. This makes it convenient to manage file backups however you want.

## Connecting via Cloudflare Tunnel

Check the [official site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) for details, but simply put, it's a free L7 tunnel service for localhost, allowing you to host services without a global IP.

However, there's a limitation: you can only send up to 100MB per request. So chunking is necessary.

## Let's Try It

I'll create a 110MB file and experiment. Set the chunk size to 110MB.
Sending a request results in error 413 Payload Too Large.
Set the chunk size to 99MB.
I confirmed the request was split into two.

Of course, this software itself has password authentication, but if you're worried about access, consider using [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/) together.
